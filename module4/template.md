   Sports: Football
   
1. Geographic Variation
Yes, because american football only has a specific geographic location: America.

have been raised about concussions and helmet safety.

3. Who does that?
Usually private companies as well as football helmet manafacturers such as "Riddell" take care of padding 
and helmet safety.

Is there a way to statistically modify gear for kids and adults to make them more lightweight and 
more safe.

  The sports market made over 71.06 billion dollars in 2018. People are still trying to figure out how 
  to make their gear more safe, durable, and lightweight.

 Ususally helmets for the NFL are a big seller, but shoulder and knee pads are needed for almost every sport.

If it is a helmet, they usually go for around 100 dollars, maybe less for kids. shoulder and knee pads should not
be more than 30 dollars.## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
That sports is not doing that much harm to our bodies.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
all the data that has come from studies about concussions and shoulder injuries in sports.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Yes because every year you get new players, and the ones that retire tend to 
speak out about these things.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
What material is the safest and most leightweight to use inside football gear?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
what materials are the safest and most legihtweight to use inside your vehicle?

What data storytelling example inspires you?
Data about how fast these cars can be made, and how fast the industry is growing for these types of cars.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
trying out different batteries to see if they get the same result as the ones that cost 50 grand to make.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Is there a way to make it wireless charging?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
what cars can be converted into wireless charghing if they dont have it?
